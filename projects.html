      <h4>What it Does</h4>
      <p>In this C# Programming assignment, I created a database-driven student registration web application using Blazor (component-based .NET web framework using C#). New students can be added and registered for a number of courses, depending on student type.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Tech Stack:</strong> C#, Blazor, SQLite, HTML, Bootstrap, Object-oriented Programming
      </p>
      <h4>Behind the Scenes</h4>
      <p>
        This project was my first time using Blazor to build an application. While there were some similarities between Blazor and React from a compenents perspective, it took some time for me to understand componements from an object-oriented perspective.   
      </p>
      <h4>Challenges</h4>
      <p>
        I had some issues creating the course registration form and ensuring the validation for different students types was working correctly. It took me some time and research to figure out the correct way to implement this, but I eventually made the form work as expected.
      </p>
      <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
      <p>
        After completing this project, I feel much more comfortable with C# and Blazor, and using Models in web development.

      <img src="docs/PokedexScreenshot.png" class="card-img-top" alt="Pokedex Project Screenshot">
      <h4>What it Does</h4>
      <p>In this Web Programming assignment, I used the <a href="https://pokeapi.co" target="_blank">PokeApi</a> to
        design and develop a
        Pokedex web application that
        displays a gallery of Pokemon with images. Users can choose to load more Pokemon, view details about a specific
        Pokemon, mark Pokemon as "caught", and "release" Pokemon.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Javascript, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap, Fetch API, localStorage
      </p>
      <h4>Behind the Scenes</h4>
      <p>I used local storage for the first time, to maintain the "caught" and "released" status of the pokemon. This
        was also my first time using Fetch API.</p>
      <h4>Challenges</h4>
      <p>
        I ran into some issues trying to set up the Bootstrap modal. Most of the Bootstrap documentation showed a button
        linked to the modal, but I wanted to open the modal using an event listener when any pokemon was clicked on. I
        tried a few different ways to make it work but didn't want to spend too much time on it. I ended up changing to
        something I knew how to do, which was using the dialog element and event listeners to create a modal instead.
      </p>
      <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
      <p>I would have liked to have figured out the Bootstrap modal and there a few small style issues that I've
        noticed, but overall I'm happy with how it turned out. It works as expected!</p>

      <img src="docs/OfficeliteScreenshot.png" class="card-img-top" alt="Officelite Project Screenshot">
      <h4>What it Does</h4>
      <p>In this Web Design assignment, I was given basic starter files. I created a two-page responsive site that
        closely resembled the mockups. Bootstrap was used extensively with some custom CSS to create a responsive
        design.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Tech Stack:</strong> CSS, HTML, Bootstrap
      </p>
      <h4>Behind the Scenes</h4>
      <p>This was the final project for my web desgin class. I was provided with basic starter files, including mockups,
        images, style guide, and text content. I was tasked with creating a responsive 2-page website that displayed
        different views for mobile, tablet and desktop.</p>
      <h4>Challenges</h4>
      <p>
        I found it difficult to know where exactly to start, since I needed to make 2 pages with 3 distinct views for
        each. In a previous project, I had started by creating the desktop view and ended with the mobile view, which
        created more work than expected. I almost had to undo several aspects to convert desktop to mobile view.
        For this project, I started with the mobile view, then made small updates to create the tablet view and finally
        the desktop view. Given that Bootstrap is designed mobile-first as well, this approach worked well for me and
      </p>
      <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
      <p>I wasn't fully satisfied with the spacing in the finished product, specifically the margin/padding of different
        components between the mobile, tablet and desktop views. I added custom padding/margins as I completed each
        view. If I were to do the project over again, I would probably format all views without adjusting the
        padding/margin, then tweak them at the end to ensure better consistency between views.</p>

      <h4>What it Does</h4>
      <p>Divi provides users with a platform to track expenses and payments with their household, roommates,
        friends, or other groups. Simply create a group, add members, and you're ready to go! Expenses are
        automatically divided between all group members, so you don't need to any calculations. If you
        accidentally overpay, Divi will track that too!</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Tech Stack:</strong> React, Javascript, SASS/SCSS, Axios, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL
      </p>
      <h4>Behind the Scenes</h4>
      <p>I worked with a partner to create this app as the final project for the Web Development Bootcamp. We had
        a week and a half to come up with an idea, make a plan, and create a full stack web application.</p>
      <p>
        I created the majority of the mockups on Figma and set up the plan/timeline for the project. I created the
        Trello board and ran our daily scrums, updating and reprioritizing tasks as we went.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned a lot of new skills on this project. It was my first time using React Router, which was
        important for navigating to the many pages we created, as well as several modals. It was also my first
        time using Material UI and I was able to play around a bit with creating themes.
      </p>
      <h4>Challenges</h4>
      <p>
        Ambitious goals were a problem from the start. There was so much we wanted to complete that we initally
        had to cut half our features while we were planning. We had to cut a few more non-essential features as we
        went to make sure we would be able to complete a viable product that we could demo.
      </p>
      <p>
        We had also underestimated how long certain tasks would take since it was our first time using React and
        Rails together, as well as React Router and GraphJS. Once we got over the initial learning curve, we were
        able to move faster but needed to reprioritize tasks.
      </p>
      <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
      <p>
        While there are a few features I would have loved to add, the app was completed and met the basic
        requirements. Users are able to create a group, add members to the group, add expenses that are
        automatically split between group members, and add payments to re-pay specific group members. The routes,
        modals, and forms all worked correctly.

      <h4>Behind the Scenes</h4>
      <p>This was the mid-term project for the Web Development Bootcamp. I had one week to work with a partner to
        make a plan and create a full stack web application. I created the mockups on Figma and set up the
        plan/timeline for the project. I created the Trello board and ran our daily scrums.</p>
      <p>
        This was the first single page application I had created, as well as the first time I was using flexbox.
      </p>
      <h4>Challenges</h4>
      <p>
        As the first project I was working on without guidance, it was hard to know where to start. It took some
        time to create a plan and figure out how to split the work between two people so that we weren't
        duplicating work. There were a few features that we didn't have time to complete and some features that
        were implemented weren't as cleanly finished as they could have been.
      </p>
      <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
      <p>
        Despite the setbacks, we were able to complete our app in the week we had available.
